# Quick Coding with Brackets 

This is the demo project to go along with the _Quick Coding with Brackets_ course by Lisa Catalano. It is a cheat sheet for keyboard shortcuts and how to use the editor on both a **Mac** and a **PC**. 

Each step or video will be tagged so you can follow along.

## My notes

I found this course by accident. It hasn't been updated in awhile but it's still relevant.  
It includes a code along project to create web pages showing the [Brackets](brackets.io) shortcuts. 

As a user of [Brackets](brackets.io) some of these shortcuts I knew, others were new to me.  (I don't claim to be an expert) 

This is a good course for anyone new to Brackets. The videos are short, informative and provide more info than just keyboard shortcuts. 

I've made some minor changes to the HTML and CSS files;  
  * corrected spelling errors  
  * changed `strong` elements to `b` elements so it's semantically correct for screen readers  
  * changed the ampersand to the HTML entity to be compliant with the [reserved characters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity) standard
